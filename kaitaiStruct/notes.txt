Kaitai Struct:
-yaml, declarative grammars
-support a lot of constraints
-compiles to many source languages including c and python
-has a visualizer to easily debug grammars!
-TONNES of grammars already including DNS
-supports swtiching endianess during a parse
-supports complex expressions for set lengths
-is there anything that recursive decent parsing can do that Kaitai can't?
  -> switching on no value (just try each...)
-since it is yaml, it is possible we'll have to extend it in some way, but I honestly doubt it because it has sooooo many grammars already
-how do you write out the data structure???
  -> NOOOOOOOO, it can't deparse :(

The objects that the parser creates don't store the input bytes :(
It does store counts and what not on the object, but I'm not even sure that the order of fields in a struct is stored...
