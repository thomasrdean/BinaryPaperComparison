Zeek also has something called "BinPAC"


spciy exposes a C++ api that would let us integrate it into a fuzzer pretty nicely I think

has hoisting

"unit parameters" allow passing data to children

enums also hold on to the original binary data, so that's good for fuzzing
I haven't seen anything that loses information as we parse (unless we omit a field's name)
